            Create a console application that will record the homework scores for each student.  
            Define a class student that contains the following information: 
            First Name, Last Name, a score for each of 5 homework assignments, and the average of those assignments.
            Declare two constructors, including one default constructor.  Create a method that will calculate 
            the average of the 5 homework assignments.  The application should accept all inputs from a user and 
            then write all of the information to a text file.  Make sure the user can input as many students 
            as they want and then can open up the text file to see all of the information.
